	abstract = {A series of CoII(sal2Bg) and RCo(sal2Bg) complexes have been prepared from the tetradentate H2(sal2Bg) diimino ligands formed by the condensation of salicyclaldehyde and various diamines. The RCo(sal2Bg) complexes (R = methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and i-propyl) are synthesized by the reactions of alkyl halides with CoI(sal2Bg)-. The complexes are characterized by UV-visible, IR, and PMR spectra. The cleavage of the cobaltcarbon bond by light, I2, CN-, HS-, R'S-, and R'SH was studied. The organic products were identified by GLPC, and the cobalt complexes by isolation and analysis. A rich variety of mechanisms is discussed.},
